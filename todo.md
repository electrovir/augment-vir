-   make a snapshot function in `@augment-vir/test` that supports both Node.js's built-in test runner's snapshot testing as well as something that works in web-test-runner.
-   fill in package.json descriptions
-   split `date-vir` into a mono-repo with a separate durations package that can be used in augment-vir without creating circular package dependencies
    -   fix in the following:
    -   `wrapPromiseInTimeout`
    -   `wait`
    -   `waitValue`
    -   `waitUntilTruthy`
    -   `Debounce`
    -   `measureExecutionDuration`
-   convert `Debounce` into an ListenTarget and emit events when:
    -   execute is called with no callback
    -   the callback is triggered
    -   the callback is skipped
