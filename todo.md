-   make a snapshot function in `@augment-vir/test` that supports both Node.js's built-in test runner's snapshot testing as well as something that works in web-test-runner.
-   fill in package.json descriptions
-   convert `Debounce` into an ListenTarget and emit events when:
    -   execute is called with no callback
    -   the callback is triggered
    -   the callback is skipped
-   deprecate run-time-assertions
-   add `mapObject` which accepts a callback that returns mapped value _and_ key.
-   finish updating `date-vir`
-   look into using typdoc plugins
    -   https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-mdn-links
    -   https://github.com/eyworldwide/typedoc-plugin-remove-references
    -   https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-plugin-missing-exports
-   export all of /core in /common (but not anywhere else)
-   remove all `run-time-assertions` imports
-   create a `merge` or `Object.assign` variant that picks the most defined entries
-   add more assertion methods:0
    -   "not" versions of most assertions
-   make all inputs readonly
-   add a pretty diff to the assertion errors like chai has
