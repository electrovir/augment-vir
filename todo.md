-   make a snapshot function in `@augment-vir/test` that supports both Node.js's built-in test runner's snapshot testing as well as something that works in web-test-runner.
-   fill in package.json descriptions
-   split `date-vir` into a mono-repo with a separate durations package that can be used in augment-vir without creating circular package dependencies
    -   fix in the following:
    -   `wrapPromiseInTimeout`
    -   `wait`
    -   `waitValue`
    -   `waitUntilTruthy`
    -   `Debounce`
    -   `measureExecutionDuration`
-   convert `Debounce` into an ListenTarget and emit events when:
    -   execute is called with no callback
    -   the callback is triggered
    -   the callback is skipped
-   deprecate run-time-assertions
    -   create new `@augment-vir/assert` package
    -   move all run-time-assertions into there
    -   merge everything under a single `assert` object, like chai
    -   include chai assertions
    -   re-export this in `@augment-vir/test` like we're currently doing for chai
-   add a function to `@augment-vir/assert` that takes an assert function input and then spits out:
    -   an `is*` function that returns a type guard
    -   an `asserts*` function that returns a assert guard
    -   an `ensure*` function that returns the input or errors if it fails the assertion (maybe?)
    -   other things?
    -   do the the same thing for conversions, but have them spit out:
        -   `to*`: converts directly maybe with invalid outputs
        -   `toMaybe*`: converts directly or undefined if error
        -   `toEnsured*` converts and errors if invalid
        -
