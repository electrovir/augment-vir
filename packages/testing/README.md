# @augment-vir/testing

`augment-vir` is a collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are functions, constants, and types typically placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory.

This `testing` package is for generic testing augments: they are meant for helping with tests and are constructed in a generic way so they can be used with any chai-compatible testing library.
