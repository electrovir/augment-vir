# @augment-vir/browser

`augment-vir` is a collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are functions, constants, and types typically placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory.

This `browser` package is for browser-specific augments: they will only work in a browser environment.
