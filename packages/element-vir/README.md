# @augment-vir/element-vir

`augment-vir` is a collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are functions, constants, and types typically placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory.

This `element-vir` package is for [`element-vir`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-vir) augments: they are intended to work alongside that package.
