# @augment-vir/node-js

`augment-vir` is a collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are functions, constants, and types typically placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory.

This `node-js` package is for Node.js-only augments: they will only work in a Node.js environment.
