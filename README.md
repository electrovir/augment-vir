# augment-vir

This is a consolidated collection of small helper functions that I constantly use across all my JavaScript and TypeScript repos. I call these functions `augments`. These are things commonly placed within a "util", or "helpers", etc. directory; they don't really have anything in common with each other except that they have almost no dependencies.

For Node.js-only augments, import `augment-vir/dist/node-only`. for Jest-only imports, import `augment-vir/dist/jest-only`;
